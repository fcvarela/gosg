// Package gosg is a lightweight scenegraph/scenetree based rendering toolkit.
// It provides a set of tools to build standalone windowed 3D applications for
// MacOS, Linux and Windows.

// Warning

// This package is experimental and expect it to break at any time. It will

// separate scenegraph + submission packages.
//
// Contributing
//
// Contributions in the form of features, improvements or even architectural
// changes are most welcome and should be submitted in the form of
