Package gosg is a lightweight scenegraph/scenetree based rendering toolkit. It provides a set of tools to build standalone windowed 3D applications for MacOS, Linux and Windows.

## Warning
This package is experimental and expect it to break at any time. It will also change dramatically when it moves to zero-dependency subpackages and separate scenegraph + submission packages.

## Contributing
Contributions in the form of features, improvements or even architectural changes are most welcome and should be submitted in the form of pull-requests following a discussion ticket/issue.
